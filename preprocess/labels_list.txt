-Initiation:information-seeking:ask-clarification 
(refers to a repetition request: the parent misheard the utterance of the child)
Since we could also interpret it as “asks for further elaboration”, we may classify it as a basic question (in opposition to an elaborate question)
Example: “can you repeat please?”, “what did you say?”, “do you mean…?”
-Initiation:information-seeking:specific-question 
(specific information, relative to context or common ground; the main difference with pedagogical questions -that may require the same answer- is the previous knowledge of the caregiver. Here, he genuinely asks about something he doesn’t know yet)
Example: “What time does Julie's birthday start?”
